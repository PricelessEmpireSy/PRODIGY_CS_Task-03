# Password Complexity Checker

## Description

This project is a simple tool that checks how strong a password is. It looks at things like the length of the password and whether it has uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It then gives feedback on how strong the password is.

## Features

- **Length Check**: Checks if the password is long enough.
- **Uppercase and Lowercase Check**: Checks if the password has both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- **Number Check**: Checks if the password has numbers.
- **Special Character Check**: Checks if the password has special characters (like !, @, #, etc.).
- **Feedback**: Tells you how strong the password is based on the checks.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Install Python**:

   - Go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/) and download Python.
   - Follow the instructions to install it on your computer.

2. **Get the Project Files**:
   - Click on the green "Code" button in the GitHub repository.
   - Choose "Download ZIP" and save the file to your computer.
   - Unzip the file to create a folder with the project files.

3. **Open the Project Folder in VSCode**:
   - Open Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
   - Go to `File > Open Folder` and select the folder you unzipped.

4. **Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)**:
   - In VSCode, open the terminal by going to `Terminal > New Terminal`.
   - Type the following command to create a virtual environment:

     ```bash
     python -m venv env
     ```

   - Activate the virtual environment:

     - On Windows:

       ```bash
       .\env\Scripts\activate
       ```

     - On macOS/Linux:

       ```bash
       source env/bin/activate
       ```

5. **Install Required Packages**:
   - No additional packages are needed for this project. The standard Python library will be used.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Program**:

   - In the VSCode terminal, type the following command to run the program:

     ```bash
     python password_checker.py
     ```

2. **Enter a Password**:
   - When prompted, type in the password you want to check and press Enter.

3. **See the Feedback**:
   - The tool will tell you how strong the password is and provide feedback on different criteria.

## Example

Here's an example of what it will look like when you run the program:

```plaintext
Enter a password to check its complexity: MyP@ssw0rd!
Password Strength: Strong
- Length: Meets requirements
- Uppercase Letters: Meets requirements
- Lowercase Letters: Meets requirements
- Numbers: Meets requirements
- Special Characters: Meets requirements
